The purpose of this Solidity smart contract is to manage a simple college system where an administrator has the ability to add students, create courses and enroll students in such courses. Through the use of require (), assert () and revert () statements, the contract demonstrates error handling and validation.

Components:

Structures:

Student: It saves student’s details like ID, name and array of enrolled courses.

Course: This structure keeps course details including the course name and credits.

State Variables:

admin: the address of contract administrator who has special permissions

studentCount:A counter that can keep track on how many total number of students have been added.

students: A mapping to store students by their ids

courses : A mapping to store courses by their names

Modifiers:

onlyAdmin: Restricts function access only for admin

Constructor :

It initializes this contract by setting this admin as a deployer of this contract as well as initializing student count with 0.

Functions :

addStudent(string memory _name): Insert a new student into the system with his/her name. This function can be called only by Admin.

addCourse(string memory _courseName, uint8 _credits) : Add a new course to the system using its name and credits. Only Admin can call this method.Use require()to ensure that course name is not empty.

enrollCourse(uint256 _studentId, string memory _courseName): This function registers a student for a particular course. It checks the existence of the student and the course using require.

assertStudentExists(uint256 _studentId): Assert that there is a student with this id using assert.

revertIfCourseDoesNotExist(string memory _courseName) : If there is no such course, we’ll use revert to provide an error message and stop execution.

Error Handling:

require(): before executing any function, it validates that some requirements have been met like valid course names, existing students among others.

assert(): Asserts specific internal assumptions and conditions; for example presence of a student.

revert(): This can be used to exit in case condition fails to hold (e.g., when some course does not exist)

This contract provides an underlying framework of controlling college system students and courses while taking care of errors for data consistency.
